## **🛠️ Tech Stack**
| Technology  | Purpose |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Python** | Backend Development |
| **Flask** | Web Framework |
| **SQLite** | Database for User Authentication |
| **TensorFlow/Keras** | Deep Learning Models |
| **Pandas, NumPy** | Data Handling & Preprocessing |
| **Jinja2** | HTML Templating |
| **CSS** | Frontend Styling |

## **🚀 How It Works**
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing** – Cleans and prepares user-uploaded images.  
2️⃣ **Model Prediction** – Uses a CNN model to classify defects (e.g., "hole," "oil spot").  
3️⃣ **Web Interface**:
   - Upload images for prediction.
   - View results dynamically.
   - Log in for personalized access.  
4️⃣ **Feedback and Contact Forms** – Allows users to provide feedback and inquiries.
